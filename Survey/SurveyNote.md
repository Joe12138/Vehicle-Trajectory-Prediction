# Technical Concepts and Terminology Definitions

- **Semantic Map:** Every type of modeling for self-driving cars requires high-resolution maps. The semantic maps are crucial for the autonomous vehicle from an operational and safety point of view. The semantic maps are providing a better understanding of AV's from their surrounding environment. The semantic maps consist of several layers such as road networks, building in 3D, lane layer, pathways and etc. 

- **Sensors:** There are three major sensors installed on self-drive cars, cameras, Radar (Radio Detection and Ranging), and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging).

- **Target Vehicles (TVs)** are those vehicles which their behavior is important to be predicted by the model and the self-drive car is in interaction with them.
- **Ego Vehicle (EV)** a self-drive car which is moving which observing the behavior of the TVs.
- **Surrounding Vehicles (SVs)** are whose behavior impacts the self-driving car. Choosing the SVs are adapting with different algorithms and depends on the model assumption Non-Effective Vehicles (NVs).
