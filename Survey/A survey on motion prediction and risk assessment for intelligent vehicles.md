### Key Points

1. The motion modeling and prediction approaches according to the kind of hypotheses the make about the modeled entities:
   -  Physics-based motion model
   - Maneuver-based motion model
   - Interaction-aware motion models

2. **Physics-based motion models**
   - represent vehicles as dynamic entities governed by the laws of physics
   -
